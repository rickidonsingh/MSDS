#### Reproducible Analysis Data Science Project


After reading a recent article and watching a debate on the topic, I chose to look at the correlation between the pursuit of continuing higher education and salary of an individual. 

Q1. Research Question:

- What significance does higher education play in an individual's payscale?

Q2. What are the cases, and how many are there? 

- There are 188,767 cases in total. All cases were used in this data analysis project.

Q3. Describe the method of data collection. 

- The original data was obtained from the US Census Bureau.  

Q4. What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?

- Observational Study

Q5. Data Source: If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.

- http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html (choose ACS 1-year PUMS ).

Q6. Response: What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?

- Both “Total Personal Income” and “Total Personal Earnings” are the response variables and are numerical.

Q7. Explanatory: What is the explanatory variable(s), and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?

- The explanatory variables are "Worker Class" (categorical), "Sex" (categorical), "Citizenship Status" (categorical), "Age"(numerical  discrete), "Educational Attainment" (categorical), "School Attending" (categorical). 


Let's begin by loading original csv file
```{r}
original_csv <- read.csv(file="csv_pny 2/ss09pny.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
dim(original_csv)

```

Next, we will create a dataframe subset
```{r}
new_csv <- data.frame(original_csv[c("AGEP", "CIT", "COW", "SCHG", "SCHL", "SEX", "PERNP", "PINCP")])
names(new_csv) <- c("Age", "Citizenship_Status", "Worker_Class",  "School_Attending", "Educational_Attainment", "SEX", "Total_Personal_Earnings", "Total_Personal_Income")
```

Let's see the dataframe
```{r}
head(new_csv, 2)
```

We can create a new csv file containing the chosen subset
```{r}
write.csv(new_csv, file = "/Users/s/Documents/MSDS/R Studio Projects/tutorial/Cuny S1/Data606/Project Proposal_data606/NY_Data.csv")
```

Load csv file
```{r}
NY_Data2 <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rickidonsingh/MSDS/master/Data%20606%20Statistics%20and%20Probability%20for%20Data%20Analytics/Projects/Project%20Proposal/NY_Data.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

```


```{r}
head(NY_Data2)
```


Q8.Relevant summary statistics

```{r}
summary(NY_Data2)
```
