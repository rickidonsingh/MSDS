    "Centrality measures can be used to predict (positive or negative) outcomes for a node.\n",

    "Your task in this week’s assignment is <b><u>to identify an interesting set of network data that is available on the web (either through web scraping or web APIs) that could be used for analyzing and comparing centrality measures across nodes.</b></u> \n",
    "As an additional constraint, there should be at least one categorical variable available for each node (such as “Male” or “Female”; “Republican”, “Democrat,” or “Undecided”, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to identifying your data source, you should create a high level plan that describes how you would load the data for analysis, and describe a hypothetical outcome that could be predicted from comparing degree centrality across categorical groups. "

    "A network of books about US politics published around the time of the 2004 presidential election and sold by the online bookseller Amazon.com. Edges between books represent frequent copurchasing of books by the same buyers. The network was compiled by V. Krebs and is unpublished, but can found on Krebs' web site. Thanks to Valdis Krebs for permission to post these data on this web site.\n",
